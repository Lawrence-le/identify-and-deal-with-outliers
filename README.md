# Identify and deal with outliers

## Objective

I will be analyzing lightning strike data obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) spanning the years 1987 to 2020 for my project document. To manage the extensive dataset, which consists of millions of rows, I've undertaken preprocessing to streamline the information, retaining only the year and the corresponding count of lightning strikes.

The primary objective of my project is to explore the variation in total lightning strike counts for each year and pinpoint any outliers within the dataset. Subsequently, I intend to visually represent the annual totals by creating a scatterplot for a more comprehensive understanding of the patterns over the examined period.
